What do I want to build?
A: A messenger app. 
What do I want to do with this app?
A:CRUD:
    -Create messages
    -Read messages
    -Update posts
    -Delete posts
Any cool features?
A:We'll deal with that later
Mmkay so... where should we start?
A: I think we should start with the logic and the templating
Logic?
A: Yeah! You know, the backbones of the app, and then we can focus on style and looks
Ohhhh Mmkay so... Where in the logic should we start?
Well...
    1. What do I want people to write?
    A:Instant messages
    2. About what?
    A:Who cares! Just let people message each other, and we can focus on the rest later on.
    3. Mmkay, so how about we send regular texts and pics and stuff?
    A: Sounds Perfect!!!
    4. So starting out with the logic.... let's have this:
        How can I send text messages?
            A: select the recipient, write text, and then press the send button.
                Code: Who knows what kind of code to write to make this work... but screw it let's do it!
        Who can I send messages to?
        Where will my messages go?
        Can there be a place where I see all of my recent messages?
        Can I send the same message to multiple people?
        How fast can it be?
        Can I create an account?
        Can I add a user profile?
        
        
        First steps:
        set up server, landing page, home page
            -create package.json, add express, ejs, and several other packages, but I'll do that all in time.
